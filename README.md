> Applying custom configurations, especially those related to your operating system, can have unexpected consequences and may interfere with your system's normal behavior. While I have tested these configurations on my own setup, there is no guarantee that they will work flawlessly on all systems. <br>

> It is highly recommended to review the configuration contents and make necessary modifications to customize it to your needs before attempting the installation.

1. **Install NixOs**

   First install nixos using any [graphical ISO image](https://nixos.org/download.html#nixos-iso). 
   > Only been tested using the Gnome graphical installer and choosing the ```No desktop``` option durring instalation.

2. **Clone the repo**

   ```
   nix-shell -p git
   git clone URL repo
   cd nixos-config
   ```
3. **Install script**

   > First make sure to read the install script, it isn't long
   
   Execute and follow the installation script :
   ```
   ./install.sh
   ```
   > You will need to change the git account yourself in ./modules/home/git.nix
4. **Reboot**

   After rebooting, you'll be greeted by swaylock prompting for your password, with the wallpaper in the background.

5. **Manual config**

   Even though I use home manager, there is still a little bit of manual configuration to do:
      - Set Aseprite theme (they are in the folder `./nixos-config/modules/home/aseprite/themes`).
      - Enable Discord theme (in Discord settings under VENCORD > Themes).
      - Configure the browser (for now, all browser configuration is done manually).
